# @inbox @nlp sutskever2014sequence

Original sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) paper from Google that
inspired transformers.

According to Wikipedia article on
[Seq2Seq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seq2seq) the original idea was
from the author of word2vec, and Google stole it.

# @inbox @nlp reimers2019sentence-bert

Recommendation from Jonathan. He advised that Sentence-BERT (SBERT) is
a better fit for our task of going from text-to-text tokens.

I followed the [tutorial on the website]() and skimmed the paper. The
code works, however I don't think it fits what I am trying to do. From
what I understand, SBERT can be used to detect weather two pieces of
texts are similar to one another (or not).

It does however fit the idea for automating the detection of related
VA pairs. Something to explore?

# Testing

The first author (Saikat Dutta) seems to be active in the field of
assertions in ML. Albeit, his focus seems to be on fixing flakiness of
tests due to the stachastic nature of ML algorithms. We on the other
hand, are focusing on the automation aspect of assertions.

Regardless, good to mention Dutta's papers in the related work section.

# @msr @notebook mojtaba2023distilkaggle


[New dataset of notebooks](https://zenodo.org/records/10317389) from Kaggle (300GB original). The authors extracted the contents of the code cells (which we did as well). However, they did not extract the outputs. Published in MSR '24 so its super fresh, DOI info is not available yet.

[Here is the code](https://github.com/theablemo/DistilKaggle) used by the authors to mine the notebooks.

# STAR @notebook ramasamy2023visualising

Jackpot.

"Garden of forking paths".

Lots of good references in the introduction for program comprehension
and challenges when working with Computational Notebooks.

Notebooks to show that data science workflow is non-linear and
contains several forks and dead-ends.

# STAR @method wohlin2012experimentation

This is the bible for empirical studies in Software Engineering. Luis
recommended this book to be way back in my first year of my Phd. It was
not that useful back then because we were still trying to find a topic.

Now in my third year, the topic is finalised and this is the time when
I am fining myself referring back to the chapters of this book to
understand and identify various methods we can use to analyse the data.

The pdf unfortunately does not have a detailed TOC. [So I refer to the
TOC on the
website](https://link-springer-com.tudelft.idm.oclc.org/book/10.1007/978-3-642-29044-2)
to identify the relevant chapters.

# @method beller2014modern

Recommendation from Caro regarding use of inter-rater agreement
between multiple annotators when conducting manual analysis.

The authors calculate Kappa for 100 random samples only. The threats
to validity section is very well written, and defends this choice of
calculating Kappa only on a small sample.

# @method fregnan2022first

This is the paper Alberto presented at SIESTA 2023. Read the
methodology to understand method used to determine sufficient number
of samples required for empirical studies.

The authors used an *a priori power analysis* to determine the number
of participants required for producing statistically significant
results.
