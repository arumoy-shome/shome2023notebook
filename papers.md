# @inbox @nlp reimers2019sentence-bert

Recommendation from Jonathan. He advised that Sentence-BERT (SBERT) is
a better fit for our task of going from text-to-text tokens.

I followed the [tutorial on the website]() and skimmed the paper. The
code works, however I don't think it fits what I am trying to do. From
what I understand, SBERT can be used to detect weather two pieces of
texts are similar to one another (or not).

It does however fit the idea for automating the detection of related
VA pairs. Something to explore?

hand, are focusing on the automation aspect of assertions.

for code generation. What prompting techniques were used? How did they
collect the data? How did then handle stochastic nature of output

# STAR @method wohlin2012experimentation

This is the bible for empirical studies in Software Engineering. Luis
recommended this book to be way back in my first year of my Phd. It was
not that useful back then because we were still trying to find a topic.

Now in my third year, the topic is finalised and this is the time when
I am fining myself referring back to the chapters of this book to
understand and identify various methods we can use to analyse the data.

The pdf unfortunately does not have a detailed TOC. [So I refer to the
TOC on the
website](https://link-springer-com.tudelft.idm.oclc.org/book/10.1007/978-3-642-29044-2)

calculating Kappa only on a small sample.
